In future we would like to implement the following features to convert-non-suexec.sh:
  1. Create backups of the existing .htaccess files
  2. Run the script per user instead of the whole machine
  3. Skip a home folder if the folder has /home/USER/.converted-to-suexec. 
     But if the file is older then 24hours check the user anyway.
